Create a VPC with an Internet Gateway:

    Go to the VPC dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
    Click on "Create VPC" and provide the necessary details such as CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
    Once the VPC is created, click on "Internet Gateways" in the left panel.
    Click on "Create internet gateway", give it a name, and then attach it to your VPC.
    Create a Public Subnet with 256 IP addresses:

Go to the Subnets section in the VPC dashboard.
    Click on "Create subnet" and provide the VPC, availability zone, and CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.0.0/24).
    Ensure that "Auto-assign public IPv4 address" is enabled.
    Create a Private Subnet with 156 IP addresses:

Follow similar steps as above but provide a different CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.1.0/25).
    Create a Route Table and Associate it with the Subnets:

Go to the Route Tables section in the VPC dashboard.
    Click on "Create route table" and provide the VPC.
    Once created, click on the "Routes" tab and add a route with destination 0.0.0.0/0 and target as the Internet Gateway.
    Go to the "Subnet associations" tab and associate the public subnet with this route table.
    Launch a Linux EC2 Instance using the VPC and Public Subnet:

Go to the EC2 dashboard.
    Click on "Launch Instance" and choose an Amazon Linux AMI or any other Linux distribution.
    Select an instance type, configure instance details (choose the VPC and public subnet), add storage, configure security groups to allow SSH (port 22) traffic, and review and launch the instance.
    Once the instance is launched, you can SSH into it using its public IP address or public DNS name.

By following these steps, you will have set up a VPC with an Internet Gateway, created a public subnet with 256 IP addresses, a private subnet with 156 IP addresses, established a route table connecting the Internet Gateway and the subnets, and launched a Linux EC2 instance using the VPC and public subnet.
