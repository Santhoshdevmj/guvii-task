Create a new directory and populate it with script files:
  >mkdir my_project
  >cd my_project
  >touch script1.sh script2.sh

Initiate an empty repository on GitHub:

Go to https://github.com and log in to your account.
Click on the "+" sign in the top right corner and select "New repository".
Enter a repository name, choose visibility options, and click "Create repository".
Convert the local directory into a Git repository:

  >git init

Link the local repository to GitHub:

Copy the URL of the GitHub repository (it should look like https://github.com/username/repository_name.git).
Add the remote repository URL to your local repository:

  >git remote add origin <repository_url>

Verify that the remote has been added:
  >git remote -v

Commit the files and push them to the GitHub repository:
  >git add .
  >git commit -m "Initial commit"
  >git push -u origin master

This will push the committed files to your GitHub repository.
