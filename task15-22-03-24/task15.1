Set up AWS CodeCommit:

Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to AWS CodeCommit.
Create a new CodeCommit repository where you will store your Nginx configuration files and static content.
Clone the CodeCommit Repository:

Clone the CodeCommit repository to your local machine using Git.
Create Nginx Configuration and Static Content:

Create an Nginx configuration file (e.g., nginx.conf) and any static content (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS files) that you want to serve.
Place these files in the local Git repository directory.
Commit and Push Changes:

Add the newly created files to the repository and commit the changes.
Push the changes to the CodeCommit repository.
Set up AWS CodeDeploy:

Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to AWS CodeDeploy.
Create a new CodeDeploy application and deployment group.
Create an AppSpec File:

Create an appspec.yml file in the root of your Git repository.
This file defines the deployment process for CodeDeploy.
Create a Deployment Script:

Create a deployment script (e.g., deploy.sh) to copy the Nginx configuration files and static content to the appropriate location on the EC2 instance.
Create an EC2 Instance:

Launch an EC2 instance where you will deploy the Nginx application.
Make sure to configure security groups to allow HTTP traffic (port 80).
Install and Configure Nginx on the EC2 Instance:

SSH into the EC2 instance and install Nginx.
Configure Nginx to serve the static content and use the Nginx configuration files from the CodeCommit repository.
Deploy the Application:

Use CodeDeploy to deploy the application to the EC2 instance.
Monitor the deployment process in the CodeDeploy console.
Access the Application via Browser:

Once the deployment is successful, you should be able to access the Nginx application via the public IP address or public DNS name of the EC2 instance in a web browser.
