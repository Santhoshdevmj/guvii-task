Syntax for all loops in shell scriptingn shell scripting, there are several ways to perform looping. Here are the syntaxes for the most common types of loops:

For Loop:
for item in list
do
  # Commands to be executed for each item in the list
done
Example:

        for i in {1..5}
        do
        echo "Number: $i"
        done

While Loop:
    while condition
    do
    # Commands to be executed as long as the condition is true
    done
Example:

        num=1
        while [ $num -le 5 ]
        do
        echo "Number: $num"
        ((num++))
        done

Until Loop:
    until condition
    do
    # Commands to be executed until the condition becomes true
    done
Example:

        num=1
        until [ $num -gt 5 ]
        do
        echo "Number: $num"
        ((num++))
        done

C-Style For Loop:
    for (( initialization; condition; increment ))
    do
    # Commands to be executed for each iteration
    done
Example:

        for (( i=1; i<=5; i++ ))
        do
        echo "Number: $i"
        done
These are the basic looping constructs in shell scripting.
